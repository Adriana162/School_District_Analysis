# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to analyze data on school performance using Pandas. The reading and math grades for Thomas High School
ninth graders appear to have been altered, so the task is to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while
keeping the rest of the data intact.

## Results

- The overall passing percentage lowered by about one percent after the ninth graders scores were replaced with NaNs for the disctrict summary . 

- The overall passing for Thomas High School summary is 90%, but it lowered to 65% after the scores were replaced.

- The reading score for Thomas High School became one of the lowest compared to the other schools. The math scores became similiar to other
schools. 

- The ninth grade column is now the value of NaN when looking at the math and reading scores by grade. The rest of the grades score
stay the same. 

- The scores by school spending, school size and school type all stayed the same as well.
